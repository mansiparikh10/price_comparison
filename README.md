**PROJECT PROPOSAL** k

**Title:- STORE: Price Comparison Web Application****

**Introduction:**
Welcome to the presentation of STORE, a price comparison web application built using Django. In this project, I aim to provide users with a convenient platform to compare the prices of various items across different offline stores. By leveraging Django's powerful framework, I will create a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for items, view their prices, and make informed purchasing decisions.

**Motivation:**
This project is born out of the personal experience and the desire to overcome the challenges faced by individuals arriving in the United States for the first time. As the creator of this project, I myself encountered difficulties when navigating through various Indian grocery stores to buy groceries and vegetables. I noticed that even though the items were similar in terms of brand and quantity, the prices varied significantly from store to store. Remembering the prices or maintaining records using Microsoft Excel became cumbersome and time-consuming after returning home. This application can potentially save hundreds of dollars for each household every year.

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to alleviate the difficulties faced by residents by providing them with a reliable tool to compare prices across different stores. By centralizing the information about prices, brands, and quantities, users can conveniently access this data through this web application and make well-informed purchasing decisions.

**Benefits:**
By utilizing this price comparison web application, users will be able to:
Save Time: Instead of physically visiting multiple stores to compare prices, users can easily access and compare prices from the comfort of their own homes.
Make Informed Decisions: By having access to price, brand, and quantity information in one place, users can make informed decisions based on their preferences and budget.
Track Expenses: The application provides a convenient way to track expenses by maintaining a record of prices paid for different items.
Savings Potential: By gaining insights into price variations and choosing the most cost-effective options, users can effectively plan their expenses and maximize their savings.

**Functionality:**
Our web application provides the following key features:
User Registration and Authentication:
Users have the option to create an account by entering a unique user ID and password. Alternatively, they can choose to continue as a guest without registering an account.
Authentication mechanisms ensure secure access to user-specific data and personalized features.
Search and Item Comparison:
Users can search for items by their name, category, or brand.
The application retrieves relevant items, prices, and quantities from the database.
Users can compare the prices of the same item across different stores.
Store Information:
Users can view detailed information about each store, including its name, zip code, and location.
This information helps users identify the nearest or most convenient store for their purchases.

**Future use case:**
Integration with offline stores other than grocery stores
Schemes & Offers advertising:
Quantity Tracking:
The application keeps track of the quantity of each item available in a store.
Users can check the availability of a specific item before making a purchase.
Price Tracking: (uploaded by store)
Coupons, Cashback & Loyalty program:

**Competition Analysis:**
While there are several web and mobile applications that offer price comparisons for online e-commerce stores and platforms, there is a noticeable gap when it comes to offline stores, especially Indian grocery stores. Our research has revealed that there are no dedicated platforms catering specifically to price comparison in this niche market.
By focusing on Indian grocery stores, I aim to address the unique needs of individuals who prefer to physically visit stores for their shopping. While online platforms provide convenience, they often lack accurate and up-to-date information about prices and availability in offline stores. This web application will fill this void by providing a comprehensive and reliable solution for comparing prices across different Indian grocery stores.
Through market research and user feedback, I will continuously improve and expand the features and functionality of our application to ensure its relevance and usefulness to our target audience. My commitment is to provide a user-friendly and valuable tool that simplifies the shopping experience for new residents and empowers them to make informed purchasing decisions.
In summary, while there are existing price comparison applications for online platforms, this project stands out by catering to the unique requirements of offline Indian grocery stores. I am excited to fill this gap in the market and provide a valuable resource for individuals facing similar challenges. 

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, STORE is an efficient and user-friendly price comparison web application that aims to simplify the shopping experience. By leveraging Django's capabilities, I am creating a platform that enables users to make informed purchasing decisions by comparing prices across different stores. Price Comparison web application is designed to address the challenges faced by residents when it comes to grocery shopping. By simplifying the process of comparing prices, brands, and quantities, I aim to empower users to make informed decisions and save time and effort. My goal is to enhance the overall shopping experience for individuals who are new to the United States. Thank you for your attention, and I am open to any further questions or suggestions.
